I have a bunch of keywords for topics I want to research in university
 - Reinforcement Learning
 - AIXI

What I need is a list of professors with publications in these areas, and their associated universities. I also want some summary statistics, including top universities and professors by aggregate count.

How can I build a tool (with python) to do this? Or does a tool already exist?

Query online and get:
 - author name
 - university or affiliated association
 - citations
 - article / publication title
 - keywords

Query either
 - Semantic scholar
 - Google scholar https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api 



Let's make this simple
 - Data storage = Pandas dataframe
 - querying with BeautifulSoup
